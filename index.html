<p class = "blue mark3"> <span>Quality assurance (QA) is a way of preventing mistakes and defects in manufactured products and avoiding problems when delivering products or services to customers; 
which ISO 9000 defines as "part of quality management focused on providing confidence that quality requirements will be fulfilled".
[1] This defect prevention in quality assurance differs subtly from defect detection and rejection in quality control and has been referred to as a shift left since it focuses on quality earlier in the process
 (i.e., to the left of a linear process diagram reading left to right)</span></p>
